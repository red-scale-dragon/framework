## History and Team
At Red Scale Corporation, we found that most of our clients use WordPress and needed us to create a custom plugin to handle their project. We created the Dragon Framework on Febby 7th, 2021 to speed up development time on those projects and offer a simple and secure way to build WordPress Plugins using Laravel components.

[After several years](https://gitlab.com/dragon-public/framework) of building and molding The 1.x version of Dragon Framework, it was finally time to rewrite it from scratch to embody everything we found essential, clean up those things that we found not used as much, and add more Laravel components into the framework, such as controllers and requests. This is the rewritten and modernized version of Dragon Framework.
